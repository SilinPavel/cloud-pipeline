## Google Cloud Platform Support

One of the major **`v0.16`** features is a support for the **[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)**.

All the features, that were previously used for **`AWS`** and **`Azure`**, are now available in all the same manner, from all the same GUI/CLI, for **`GCP`**.

This provides an even greater level of a flexibility to launch different jobs in the locations, closer to the data, with cheaper prices or better compute hardware in depend on a specific task.

## Displaying Cloud Provider's icon for the storage/compute resources

As were presented in **[v0.15](../v.0.15/v.0.15_-_Release_notes.md#microsoft-azure-support)**, Cloud Pipeline can manage multi Cloud Providers in a single installation.

In the current version, useful icon-hints with the information about using Cloud Provider are introduced.  
If a specific platform deployment has a number of Cloud Providers registered (e.g. `AWS`+`Azure`, `GCP`+`Azure`) - corresponding icons/text information are displaying next to the cloud resource.

Such cloud resources are:

- **`Object/File Storages`** (icons in the **Library**, at the "DATA" panel of the **Dashboard** etc.)

- **`Regions`** (icons in the **Cloud Regions** configuration, at the **Launch** form etc.)

- **`Running jobs`**:
    - text hints (at the **RUNS** page)

    - icons (at the **Run logs** page, at the "RUNS" panels of the **Dashboard**)

> **Note**: this feature is not available for deployments with a **_single_** Cloud Provider.

## Configurable timeout of GE Autoscale waiting for a worker node up

Previously, `GE Autoscaler` waited for a worker node up for a fixed timeout. This could lead to incorrect behavior for specific **CLoud Providers**, because the timeout can be very different.

Current version extracts `GE Autoscaler` polling timeout to a new system preference **`ge.autoscaling.scale.up.polling.timeout`**.  
That preference defines how many seconds `GE Autoscaler` should wait for **pod initialization** and **run initialization**.  
Default value is `600` seconds (`10` minutes).

## Notable Bug fixes

### Worker nodes fail due to mismatch of the regions with the parent run

[#485](https://github.com/epam/cloud-pipeline/issues/485)

In certain cases, when a new child run was launching in cluster, cloud region was not specified directly and it might be created in a region differing from the parent run, that could lead to fails.  
Now, worker runs inherit parent's run cloud region.

### Detached configuration doesn't respect region setting

[#458](https://github.com/epam/cloud-pipeline/issues/458)

Region setting was not applied when pipeline is launched using detached configuration.  
Now, cloud region ID is merged into the detached configuration settings.

### Incorrect displaying of the "Start idle" checkbox

[#418](https://github.com/epam/cloud-pipeline/issues/418)

If for the configuration form with several tabs user was setting the **Start idle** checkbox on any tab and then switched between sub-configurations tabs - the "checked" state of the **Start idle** checkbox didn't change, even if **Cmd template** field was appearing with its value (these events are mutually exclusive).

### Limit check of the maximum cluster size is incorrect

[#412](https://github.com/epam/cloud-pipeline/issues/412)

Maximum allowed number of runs (size of the cluster) created at once is limited by system preference **`launch.max.scheduled.number`**. This check used strictly "less" check rather then "less or equal" to allow or deny cluster launch.  
Now, the "less or equal" check is used.

### Incorrect behavior while download files from external resources into several folders

[#373](https://github.com/epam/cloud-pipeline/issues/373)

If user was tried to download files from external resources and at the **Transfer settings** form was set **Create folders for each _path_ field** checkbox without setting any name field, all files downloaded into one folder without creating folders for each path field (column).

### Detach configuration doesn't setup SGE for a single master run

[#342](https://github.com/epam/cloud-pipeline/issues/342)

`Grid Engine` installation was mistakenly being skipped, if pipeline was launched with enabled system parameter **`CP_CAP_SGE`** via a detach configuration.
